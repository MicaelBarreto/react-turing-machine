```

## Theory && Examples

### Theory
The Turing Machine as the name says was idealized by Alan Turing and it is a machine that manipulates a strip of tape depending on some rules. On the formal definition of Turing Machine it is a 7-tuple of symbols with meanings that is:

- Q: Set of states
- &Sigma;: Set of input symbols
- &Gamma;: Acceptable Tape symbols
- q0: Start State
- &empty;: blank Symbol
- F: Set of final states
- &delta;: Set of transitions
